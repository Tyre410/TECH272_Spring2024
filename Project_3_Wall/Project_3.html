            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><!--link sends you back to top-->
            <p>Henri Duchamp was a French painter, sculptor, chess player, and writer whose work is associated with Cubism, Dada, and conceptual art.He is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture.He has had an immense impact on 20th&ndash; and 21st&ndash;century art, and a seminal influence on the development of conceptual art.</p>

            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>

            <p>Duchamp was born at Blainville&ndash;Crevon in Normandy, France, to Eugène Duchamp and Lucie Duchamp (formerly Lucie Nicolle) and grew up in a family that enjoyed cultural activities. The art of painter and engraver Émile Frédéric Nicolle, his maternal grandfather, filled the house, and the family liked to play chess, read books, paint, and make music together. Of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp's seven children, one died as an infant and four became successful artists.At eight years old, Duchamp followed in his brothers' footsteps when he left home and began schooling at the Lycée Pierre&ndash;Corneille, in Rouen. Two other students in his class also became well&ndash;known artists and lasting friends: Robert Antoine Pinchon and Pierre Dumont. For the next eight years, he was locked into an educational regime which focused on intellectual development. Though he was not an outstanding student, his best subject was mathematics and he won two mathematics prizes at the school. He also won a prize for drawing in <time datetime="1903">1903</time>, and at his commencement in <time datetime="1904">1904</time> he won a coveted first prize, validating his recent decision to become an artist. He learned academic drawing from a teacher who unsuccessfully attempted to "protect" his students from Impressionism, Post&ndash;Impressionism, and other avant&ndash;garde influences. However, Duchamp's true artistic mentor at the time was his brother Jacques Villon, whose fluid and incisive style he sought to imitate.</p> 
            
            <p>Of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp's seven children, one died as an infant and four became successful artists. Marcel Duchamp was the brother of:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Jacques Villon (<time datetime="1875">1875</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1963">1963</time>), painter, printmaker</li>
                <li>Raymond Duchamp-Villon (<time datetime="1876">1876</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1918">1918</time>), sculptor</li>
                <li>Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (<time datetime="1889">1889</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1963">1963</time>), painter</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Early Work</h3>

                <p>Duchamp's early art works align with Post&ndash;Impressionist styles. He experimented with classical techniques and subjects. When he was later asked about what had influenced him at the time, Duchamp cited the work of Symbolist painter Odilon Redon, whose approach to art was not outwardly anti&ndash;academic, but quietly individual.</p>

                <p>He studied art at the Académie Julian from <time datetime="1904">1904</time> to <time datetime="1905">1905</time>, but preferred playing billiards to attending classes. During this time, Duchamp drew and sold cartoons which reflected his ribald humor. Many of the drawings use verbal puns (sometimes spanning multiple languages), visual puns, or both. Such play with words and symbols engaged his imagination for the rest of his life. In <time datetime="1905">1905</time>, he began his compulsory military service with the 39th Infantry Regiment, working for a printer in Rouen. There he learned typography and printing processes&mdash;skills he would use in his later work.</p>

                <p>Owing to his eldest brother Jacques' membership in the prestigious Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture Duchamp's work was exhibited in the <time datetime="1908">1908</time> Salon d'Automne, and the following year in the Salon des Indépendants. Fauves and Paul Cézanne's proto&ndash;Cubism influenced his paintings, although the critic Guillaume Apollinaire&mdash;who was eventually to become a friend&mdash;criticized what he called "Duchamp's very ugly nudes" ("les nus très vilains de Duchamp"). Duchamp also became lifelong friends with exuberant artist Francis Picabia after meeting him at the <time datetime="1911">1911</time> Salon d'Automne, and Picabia proceeded to introduce him to a lifestyle of fast cars and "high" living.</p>

                <h3>Late Career</h3>

                <P>Although Duchamp was no longer considered to be an active artist, he continued to consult with artists, art dealers and collectors. From <time datetime="1925">1925</time> he often traveled between France and the United States, and made New York's Greenwich Village his home in <time datetime="1942">1942</time>. He also occasionally worked on artistic projects such as the short film Anémic Cinéma (<time datetime="1926">1926</time>), Box in a Valise (<time datetime="1935">1935</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1941">1941</time>), Self Portrait in Profile (1958) and the larger work Étant Donnés (<time datetime="1946">1946</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1966">1966</time>). In <time datetime="1943">1943</time>, he participated with Maya Deren in her unfinished film The Witch's Cradle, filmed in Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery.</P>

                <p>Duchamp's influence on the art world remained behind the scenes until the late 1950s, when he was "discovered" by young artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, who were eager to escape the dominance of Abstract Expressionism. He was a co&ndash;founder of the international literary group Oulipo in <time datetime="1960">1960</time>. Interest in Duchamp was reignited in the 1960s, and he gained international public recognition. In <time datetime="1963">1963</time>, the Pasadena Art Museum mounted his first retrospective exhibition, and there he appeared in an iconic photograph playing chess opposite nude model Eve Babitz. The photograph was later described by the Smithsonian Archives of American Art as being "among the key documentary images of American modern art".</p>

                <p>Duchamp's final major art work surprised the art world, which believed he had given up art for chess 25 years earlier. Entitled Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage ("Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas"), it is a tableau, visible only through a peep hole in a wooden door. A nude woman may be seen lying on her back with her face hidden, legs spread, and one hand holding a gas lamp in the air against a landscape backdrop. Duchamp had worked secretly on the piece from <time datetime="1946">1946</time> to <time datetime="1966">1966</time> in his Greenwich Village studio while even his closest friends thought he had abandoned art. The torso of the nude figure is based on Duchamp's lover, the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, with whom he had an affair from <time datetime="1946">1946</time> to <time datetime="1951">1951</time>.</p>

                <p>Duchamp died suddenly and peacefully in the early morning of 2 October <time datetime="1968">1968</time> at his home in Neuilly&ndash;sur&ndash;Seine, France. After an evening dining at home with his friends Man Ray and Robert Lebel, Duchamp retired at 1:05 am, collapsed in his studio, and died of heart failure.</p>

                <p>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (French: Nu descendant un escalier n° 2) is a <time datetime="1912">1912</time> painting by Marcel Duchamp. The work is widely regarded as a Modernist classic and has become one of the most famous of its time. Before its first presentation at the <time datetime="1912">1912</time> Salon des Indépendants in Paris it was rejected by the Cubists as being too Futurist. It was then exhibited with the Cubists at Galeries Dalmau&rsquo;s Exposició d'Art Cubista, in Barcelona, 20 April&ndash;10 May <time datetime="1912">1912</time>. The painting was subsequently shown, and ridiculed, at the <time datetime="1913">1913</time> Armory Show in New York City.</p>

                <p>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 was reproduced by Guillaume Apollinaire in his <time datetime="1913">1913</time> book, Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques. It is now in the Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>

                <h4>The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even</h4>

                <p>The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (La mariée mise à nu par ses célibataires, même), most often called The Large Glass (Le Grand Verre), is an artwork by Marcel Duchamp over 9 feet (2.7 m) tall and almost 6 feet (1.76m) wide. Duchamp worked on the piece from <time datetime="1915">1915</time> to <time datetime="1923">1923</time> in New York City, creating two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust. It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship. Duchamp&rsquo;s ideas for the Glass began in <time datetime="1912">1912</time>, and he made numerous notes and studies, as well as preliminary works for the piece. The notes reflect the creation of unique rules of physics, and myth which describes the work.</p>

                <p>The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even is also the title given to The Green Box notes (<time datetime="1934">1934</time>) as Duchamp intended the Large Glass to be accompanied by a book, in order to prevent purely visual responses to it. The notes describe that his "hilarious picture" is intended to depict the erotic encounter between the "Bride", in the upper panel, and her nine "Bachelors" gathered timidly below in an abundance of mysterious mechanical apparatus in the lower panel. The Large Glass was exhibited in <time datetime="1926">1926</time> at the Brooklyn Museum before it was broken during transport and intentionally left broken by Duchamp. He decided not to change the glass but to glue the pieces back together. It is now part of the permanent collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Duchamp sanctioned replicas of The Large Glass, the first in <time datetime="1961">1961</time> for an exhibition at Moderna Museet in Stockholm and another in <time datetime="1966">1966</time> for the Tate Gallery in London. The third replica is in Komaba Museum, University of Tokyo.</p>
                
                <p>The Large Glass consists of two glass panels, suspended vertically and measuring 109.25 in × 69.25 in (277.5 cm × 175.9 cm). The entire composition is shattered, but it rests sandwiched between two pieces of glass, set in a metal frame with a wooden base. The top rectangle of glass is known as the Bride&rsquo;s Domain; the bottom piece is the Bachelors&rsquo; Apparatus. It consists of many geometric shapes melding together to create large mechanical objects, which seem to almost pop out from the glass and ever&ndash;changing background.</p>

                <p>Fountain is a readymade sculpture by Marcel Duchamp in <time datetime="1917">1917</time>, consisting of a porcelain urinal signed "R. Mutt". In April <time datetime="1917">1917</time>, an ordinary piece of plumbing chosen by Duchamp was submitted for an exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, the inaugural exhibition by the Society to be staged at the Grand Central Palace in New York. When explaining the purpose of his readymade sculpture, Duchamp stated they are "everyday objects raised to the dignity of a work of art by the artist&rsquo;s act of choice." In Duchamp&rsquo;s presentation, the urinal&rsquo;s orientation was altered from its usual positioning. Fountain was not rejected by the committee, since Society rules stated that all works would be accepted from artists who paid the fee, but the work was never placed in the show area. Following that removal, Fountain was photographed at Alfred Stieglitz&rsquo;s studio, and the photo published in the Dada journal The Blind Man. The original has been lost.</p>

                <p>The work is regarded by art historians and theorists of the avant&ndash;garde as a major landmark in 20th&ndash;century art. Sixteen replicas were commissioned from Duchamp in the 1950s and 1960s and made to his approval. Some have suggested that the original work was by the female artist Elsa von Freytag&ndash;Loringhoven who had submitted it to Duchamp as a friend, but art historians maintain that Duchamp was solely responsible for Fountain&rsquo;s presentation.</p>
